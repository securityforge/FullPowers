# FullPowers
FullPowers is a Windows privilege escalation research tool that allows a standard user to regain full administrative privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) in situations where the user is part of the Administrators group but is running without elevated token privileges due to UAC or filtered tokens.
